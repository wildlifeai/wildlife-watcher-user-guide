## Connecting your Wildlife Watcher to LoRaWAN (New Zealand)

Your Wildlife Watcher camera can report home over **LoRaWAN** — a long-range,
very low-power radio network. This guide explains what that gives you, and the
three ways to get connected in Aotearoa New Zealand.

### What the camera sends (and what it doesn't)

- **Heartbeats** — a tiny status message with battery level, firmware version
  and how many times the camera has been triggered. You choose how often
  (from minutes for testing to once or twice a day in the field).
- **Instant detection alerts** — the moment the on-device AI recognises the
  animal (or person) it is watching for, it sends an alert. These appear on
  the wildlife.ai website's Realtime page within seconds.
- **Not photos.** Images are far too big for LoRaWAN — they stay on the SD
  card and reach the cloud when you collect the card or sync with the mobile
  app. LoRaWAN is the "is my camera alive, and did it see something?" channel.

The camera needs **no internet and no SIM card** — it only needs to be within
radio range of a LoRaWAN **gateway**. The gateway is the part that needs
internet. Realistic range in NZ terrain: several kilometres with clear line of
sight from a well-placed gateway, but dense bush eats the signal — plan for
hundreds of metres to ~2 km in real bush, and mount the gateway as high as
you can.

Radio legalities: LoRaWAN in NZ uses the 915–928 MHz band, which is
licence-free under RSM's General User Radio Licence. There is nothing to
apply for. Wildlife Watchers ship configured for the **AS923-1** frequency
plan — if you run your own network on a different plan, tell us before we
ship your cameras.

### Which path is yours?

```
Does your site already have LoRaWAN coverage you can use?
│
├─ YES — and we run or manage the network ourselves ──────► Option 1
│
├─ NO — but we're comfortable setting up a gateway ───────► Option 2
│
└─ NO / not sure / we'd rather it just worked ────────────► Option 3
```

## Option 1 — You already run a LoRaWAN network

*For councils, iwi/hapū environmental units, universities and trapping
networks that already operate The Things Network (TTN), ChirpStack or
similar.*

**What you need from us** (all visible in the mobile app and on the device's
page on the website):

- The device's **DevEUI, JoinEUI (AppEUI) and AppKey** — OTAA join,
  LoRaWAN 1.0.x, Class A.
- Frequency plan **AS923-1** (other plans, e.g. AU915, are possible as a
  firmware build option — ask before deployment; it cannot be changed in the
  field).
- Uplinks arrive on **FPort 2**. We publish the payload format and a
  ready-made JavaScript decoder that works as a TTN payload formatter or
  ChirpStack codec — ask us for the current version, or find it in the
  wildlife.ai backend repository (`lorawan-ingest`).

**What we need from you:** an HTTP webhook from your network server to your
wildlife.ai ingest address. We issue each organisation a webhook URL with its
own token; TTN v3 and ChirpStack v4 formats are both accepted. Once that is
wired, heartbeats and detection alerts appear on your project's Realtime page
automatically.

**Checklist:** register the device → confirm it joins on your network server
→ trigger a heartbeat from the mobile app → see it appear on the wildlife.ai
Realtime page. Done.

## Option 2 — Build your own coverage

*For groups happy to do a bit of DIY. You do NOT need to run any server
software — a gateway plus the free The Things Network is enough.*

**The honest coverage picture:** there is no nationwide public LoRaWAN in NZ
you can count on at a conservation site. TTN has active communities in the
main centres, and some regions have community networks (for example IoT
Taranaki) — worth checking — but assume a rural site has nothing until proven
otherwise.

**The realistic default: your own gateway.**

1. **Buy a gateway.** For a powered site (house, woolshed, hut with solar),
   an indoor gateway like the Seeed SenseCAP M2 (AS923 model) is what
   wildlife.ai tests against — around NZ$150. For remote sites, budget for a
   weatherproof outdoor gateway plus solar power and a 4G router.
2. **Give it internet.** Ethernet or Wi-Fi where available; a 4G SIM
   elsewhere. Remember: only the gateway needs internet — the cameras don't.
3. **Point it at The Things Network** (free): register the gateway on the
   TTN AU1 cluster with the frequency plan *Asia 920–923 MHz (AS923-1)*.
   wildlife.ai maintains a step-by-step gateway guide for the SenseCAP M2 —
   ask us for it.
4. **Register your cameras** on TTN using the credentials shown in the
   mobile app, then add the wildlife.ai webhook (we'll send you your
   organisation's URL and token). From here everything behaves like Option 1.

**Siting tips:** height beats power — get the gateway antenna as high as
possible with the clearest view towards your cameras. A simple site survey:
set a camera's heartbeat to every few minutes, walk it around the block, and
watch which spots check in on the Realtime page.

## Option 3 — wildlife.ai sets it up with you

*The default for most community groups: we make the radio part invisible.*

- **Pre-provisioned cameras** — your Wildlife Watchers arrive already
  registered on the network; nothing to type in.
- **A pre-configured gateway kit** — indoor or solar/4G outdoor. Plug it into
  power and internet (or insert the SIM) and your site is live. We monitor
  gateway health remotely.
- **Joining existing networks** — if your region already has coverage (a TTN
  community, a council network), we handle the registration and plumbing with
  the operator instead.
- **The dashboard is included** — heartbeats (battery, trigger counts) and
  instant detection alerts on your project's Realtime page, with alert rules.

What we ask from you: power and internet (or a 4G plan) for the gateway, and
a conversation about your site's terrain before we ship, so we get the
coverage right the first time.
